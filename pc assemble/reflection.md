<h1>About PC Assemble </h1>
<>br<br>
    <p>During the PC assembly session, I gained insight into the internal components of a computer that I had never encountered before. Initially, participants were organized into groups of four or five members, with each group sharing a single CPU. The CPU was disassembled before we reassembled it collectively. Subsequently, we installed the motherboard into the CPU frame. Following the motherboard installation, we placed the processor and cooler fan in position. We ensured the processor was correctly aligned before securing it.

Afterwards, we inserted the cooler fan into the processor and secured it. The power supply wire was also connected to the motherboard. Following that, the RAM board was inserted into the frame. Finally, we plugged in the VGA card, wire card, and all other cables before installing the cover case.

This experience felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I will never forget. I also learned about the functions of each component in the CPU and how they contribute to the overall system, thanks to Dr. Noorminshah and the technicians.</p>

    <p>Having a quiz at the end of the session is perfect to recap the session of PC assembly.</p>
    <p>I've always enjoyed watching PC building videos online, so this experience was remarkable.</p>
    <p>All in all, I had fun throughout this activity!</p>
